# Time Series / Weather Prediction Project
This repository contains one of my projects as a data science student, in it:
* Weather data is cleaned and processed 
* Missing values are filled using a Random Forest Regressor
* Data is explored
* Trend-Seasonality is modeled
* Remainder is extracted, explored and modeled
* a comprehensice model is compiled and used to predict

The data was obtained from www.ecad.eu.
